This is my first real approach to learn some assembly language. I chosed Z80 assembly for Gameboy Classic. Everybody knows this (not so) little handheld console as it became legend. I always wanted to have one and finally as a 34 I bought one. Playing on it is a real fun, but being a natural born programmer I ended up by tinkering with some code samples :)

So, here it is - my first attempt to write a simple game using Z80 assembly. It can be run on emulator like no$gmb. It won't probably run properly on real devide because it has never been prepared for that.

If you want to build it you need to download and install latest version of RGBDS assembler and linker, no$gmb and modify paths in build scripts. Have fun !!!
